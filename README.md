## Summary

The Pomodoro Timer is the same as other Pomodoro Timers found on the web. This was created with React.

The app is really easy to use. You set the amount of time you'd like to focus on any given task. You can choose between 5 and 60 minutes, in 5 minute intervals. You then set how long your break will be. This will get you to step away from the task so you can give your mind a break. The break duration is between 1 and 15 minutes, in 1 minute intervals.

You will see your time remaining as well as a progress bar giving a visual representation of how much time is left in your current state.

This app was created to help get more familiar with React components and using state variables.
